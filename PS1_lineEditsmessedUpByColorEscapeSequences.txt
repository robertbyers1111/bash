I had the same issue, and I don't think the problem has to do with the TERM variable. In
fact, I tried changing it to "ansi" myself, and emacs got all screwed up.

You didn't put the value of PS1 in your original post, so I can only assume you're
having the same issues I was, which was failing to mark the ANSI escape sequences as
non-printing characters.

Before I had the following value for PS1:

        '\e[0;34m\h:\w [\!]\$\e[0m '

which gave me a nice blue prompt of the following form

        hostname:working-directory [command-number]$

However, I had the same line-wrapping problem you did. The fix was to insert \[ and \]
around the ANSI escapes so that the shell knows not to include them in the line wrapping
calculation. This results in the following value for PS1:

        '\[\e[0;34m\]\h:\w [\!]\$\[\e[m\] '
